## Why, What and How, Installation, Usage, Contributors, and Testing
#### (why)
<br><br>
Project Why: In the continued effort to streamline your life, this budget management application was developed. We need one place to look for how our finances stand so we know whether we can afford that last-minute safari in Africa (or, in my case, that latte at Starbucks).
<br><br>
Project What: This application is special because it is able to be utilized both fully online and when disconnected as a true Progressive Web App - uploading changes at the next online opportunity. (Like when you get back to the hotel after a day traipsing the savanna.)
<br><br>
Project How: Heroku-hosted, Mongo-supported.
<br><br>
